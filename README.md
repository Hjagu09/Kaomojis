[try it out here](https://hjagu09.github.io/Kaomojis/)
 
kaomojis are japanese emojis made out of text symbols. I like kaomojis but
had to copy paste them. For that reson i created this project.

ways to accses the kaomojis:
----------------------------

- on the web (only some are avalibale)
- via the download button on the web (~17 000)
- by running `main.py 0 > smiles.csv` (all ~8 000 000)
